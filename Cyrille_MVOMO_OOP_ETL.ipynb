        "**STORY**\n",
        "\n",
        "I am a young Data Scientist working at CYPARTNERS.  CYPARTNERS is a consulting firm created in 2020 (31st October) by the former NBA star Mr. CYRILLE (Founder, CEO, Major shareholder).  The firm is specialized in the accompaniment of professional athletes in their daily life in order to bring answers to their problems outside the field, whether they are economic, legal or media related. The firm's slogan is 'Make Cash in a safe way Babies...'\n",
        "\n",
        "**On the economic level**, the firm aims to make their clients' off-field earnings grow thanks to the services of the best investment banker in the world, Ms. Cash. **On the legal level**, the firm aims to defend the interests of their clients when they are involved in a legal case by providing them with the best lawyer in the world: Mr. Data. Finally, **on the media level**, the firm aims to expand the popularity of their clients by providing them the services of the best communication expert in the world: Mr. Lebeauparleur.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After his amazing career, Mr Cyrille became a great buisnessman. In addition to CYPARTNERS, he owns 350 theaters around the world. Unfortunately, due to the COVID 19 epidemic, he is facing an extremely difficult financial situation. To avoid bankruptcy, he urgently needs to expand the CYPARTNERS business by attracting more customers and shareholders.\n",
        "To achieve this, he thinks that the firm's communication needs to change. He therefore decided to modify the firm's web page by posting a document praising CYPARTNERS' excellent results. \n",
        "\n",
        "This document shows that:\n",
        "Economically, for each of its clients, the firm managed to **increase the off-field earnings between 1 and 3 times (CYPARTNERS 10% commision excluded) ** (compared to the moment when they join CYPARTNERS).  On the media level, for each of its clients, CYPARTNERS manages to increase between 2 and 5 times the rate of increase of their number of followers.Finally, on the legal front, for each client, CYPARTNERS has managed to reduce by 2 the number of legal expenses of their clients. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result of this decision, despite the strong increase in the number of visitors to the website, the activity of CYPARTNERS is not evolving significantly. That's why he asked me urgently to provide him with a table that will be automatically sent to each person consulting the web page. He assumes that all visitors are either potential clients (i.e. high level athletes) or potential shareholders so the table should be strongly dedicated to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "He wants this table to **highlight certain very specific things and be as meaningful as possible**. In summary for the athletes, the table must underline what CYPARTNERS brought them by comparing their situation before vs after, and for the investors the table must underline their potential gain at CYPARTNERS. \n",
        "\n",
        "The only source of income for CYPARTNERS comes from the 10 percent retrocession concluded with their clients on their off-field earnings. CYPARTNERS'sources of expenditure come from the fees of their 3 collaborators (Mr Data, Ms Cash and MR Lebeauparleur) and the payroll of the 3 employees. He gave me a really messy txt. file (which contains some infos of our clients for their first year as customers) and I have to do it before the end of the day. Otherwise I will be fired!!!\n",
        "The expected cost of a lawsuit is 10 000 euros.\n",
        "Mr. Data's, Mr. Lebeauparleur's, and Ms. Cash's  fees are 50 000 euros per meeting per client. They are working together on each meeting so the total amount for each meeting is 150 000 euros. The payroll of the 3 employees are about 150 000 euros per client per meetings. They are working together also working together on each neetings with the collaborators so the total expenditure is 300 000 euros per client per meetings.\n",
        "CYPARTNERS is a neutral gender company so the report should be neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before CYPARTNERS, for each clients, the rate of increase is between 1 and 2 times bigger than the average rate of increase which is equal to 12.6 percents annually. With CYPARTNERS, for each clients, the rate of increase is between 2 and 5 times bigger than the rate of increase before CYPARTNERS.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 3 to 15 meetings per year per client\n",
        "For each new clients, the firm offer a gift of 2 millions of euros which is the departure investment."
